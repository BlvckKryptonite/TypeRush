## Key Components

### Game Engine (`TypingGame` class)

- Manages core logic: timer, word generation, difficulty, scoring.
- Handles all game state transitions (start, pause, finish).
- Encapsulates game logic for testability and scalability.

### Difficulty System

- **Beginner**: 60 common English words.
- **Intermediate**: 48 programming/tech-related terms.
- **Advanced**: 40+ complex or uncommon words.
- Dynamic progression encourages skill building and replayability.

### Live Statistics

- **WPM (Words Per Minute)**: Based on correctly submitted words.
- **CPM (Characters Per Minute)**: Total characters typed, including spaces.
- **Accuracy %**: Percentage of correct characters.
- **Streak**: Tracks consecutive correct entries.

## System Architecture

### Game Flow

```text
User loads page â†’ Game initializes â†’ User selects difficulty â†’ Clicks Start â†’
Random word displayed â†’ User types and submits â†’ Stats and timer update â†’
Game ends after time runs out â†’ Final score shown and saved

### 1. Game Initialization
```
User loads page â†’ TypingGame class instantiated â†’ DOM elements bound â†’ Default state set
```

### 2. Game Session Flow
```
User selects difficulty â†’ Clicks start â†’ Word generated â†’ User types â†’ 
Real-time validation â†’ Statistics updated â†’ Timer countdown â†’ Game ends â†’ Results displayed
```

### 3. Statistics Calculation
- **WPM**: Words per minute based on completed words
- **CPM**: Characters per minute including spaces
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct characters typed
- **Streak**: Consecutive correct words
