# Typing Speed Test Application

## Overview

This is a client-side typing speed test application built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application provides users with a gamified typing experience featuring multiple difficulty levels, real-time statistics tracking, and a modern, responsive user interface.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Pure vanilla web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+)
- **Architecture Pattern**: Single Page Application (SPA) with object-oriented JavaScript
- **Design Pattern**: Class-based architecture with centralized game state management
- **Styling Approach**: CSS3 with modern features including gradients, flexbox, and responsive design

### Key Design Decisions
- **No Framework Dependency**: Chosen for simplicity, fast loading, and minimal overhead
- **Class-based Game Logic**: Encapsulates game state and methods in a single `TypingGame` class for better organization
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach ensuring compatibility across devices

## Key Components

### 1. Game Engine (`TypingGame` class)
- **Purpose**: Core game logic and state management
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Word generation and difficulty management
  - Timer and statistics calculation
  - Game flow control (start, pause, restart)
  - Real-time performance tracking

### 2. User Interface Components
- **Header**: Title and difficulty selector
- **Stats Bar**: Real-time display of WPM, CPM, accuracy, time, and streak
- **Word Display**: Current word presentation
- **Input Controls**: Start/restart buttons and text input field

### 3. Difficulty System
- **Beginner Mode**: Common English words (60 basic words)
- **Intermediate Mode**: Programming and tech-related terms (48 words)
- **Advanced Mode**: Complex vocabulary including technical terms (40+ challenging words)
- **Rationale**: Provides scalable challenge levels for different skill levels

## Data Flow

### 1. Game Initialization
```
User loads page → TypingGame class instantiated → DOM elements bound → Default state set
```

### 2. Game Session Flow
```
User selects difficulty → Clicks start → Word generated → User types → 
Real-time validation → Statistics updated → Timer countdown → Game ends → Results displayed
```

### 3. Statistics Calculation
- **WPM**: Words per minute based on completed words
- **CPM**: Characters per minute including spaces
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct characters typed
- **Streak**: Consecutive correct words

## External Dependencies

### Runtime Dependencies
- **None**: Pure vanilla JavaScript implementation
- **Browser APIs**: Standard DOM manipulation and timer functions

### Development Dependencies
- **None**: No build process or compilation required
- **Deployment**: Static file hosting compatible

## Deployment Strategy

### Hosting Requirements
- **Type**: Static file hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or simple web server)
- **Files**: Three core files (index.html, style.css, script.js)
- **Browser Support**: Modern browsers with ES6+ support

### Performance Considerations
- **Load Time**: Minimal due to no external dependencies
- **Memory Usage**: Lightweight with efficient DOM manipulation
- **Scalability**: Client-side only, no server resources required

### Deployment Process
1. Upload files to static hosting service
2. Ensure proper MIME types for CSS and JS files
3. Optional: Enable HTTPS for modern browser features
4. No build step or compilation required

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Potential Additions
- **Local Storage**: Save high scores and user preferences
- **Word Lists**: Expandable vocabulary with custom word sets
- **Themes**: Multiple UI themes and color schemes
- **Multiplayer**: Real-time competitive typing races
- **Analytics**: Detailed performance tracking over time

### Technical Improvements
- **Progressive Web App**: Offline capability and app-like experience
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Enhanced accessibility and power user features
- **Sound Effects**: Audio feedback for typing events
- **Custom Difficulties**: User-defined word lists and time limits
